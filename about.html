                    <p class="bio-text" id="section-one">I've always had an interest in computers. Going onto our old family computer and playing Solitaire and Pinball got me addicted.
                                I was around 11 years old when I was enrolled in a Junior Digital Media bootcamp which taught me basic HTML. Whilst others followed the teacher and
                                only worked on it at class, I kept on working on it at home, looking up cool things to add. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="bio-text" id="section-two">Fast forward to today, and I love being able to create things from scratch that can simplify a task. Python projects are a favourite of mine,
                        however I do enjoy creating responsive websites that are visually appealing.

                <div id="experience" class="content-section" style="display: none;">
                    <h2>Experience</h2>
                    <p class="experience-text" id="section-one">My first job was working as a nightfill staff member for a local supermarket whilst in high school. After graduating high school, I took
                        multiple customer service jobs over the next 12 or so years, learning how to critically think and problem solve. I truly believe these experiences have helped me to become a
                        better developer.
                </p>
                <p class="experience-text" id="section-two">Now that I've mastered the art of complaint resolution, it's definitely time to start the career I've always wanted to have.
                    Currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology (Computer Science) at the Queensland University of Technology, I'm excited for what's to come and the knowledge I'll
                    gain.

                    <h2>Interests</h2>
                    <p class="interests-text" id="section-one">Apart from all things tech-related, I'm a massive sports fan, frequently watching the NRL as an avid supporter of the Brisbane Broncos.
                        I also played a lot of volleyball when I was younger and helped create an amateur sports club that is still operating now. I like to play guitar and ukulele as well
                </p>
                <p class="interests-text" id="section-two">Traveling and exploring are two hand-in-hand activities that I plan to do a lot more of. Having already visited Indonesia and the Philippines, there
                    are so many more places on my bucket list. I have a fascination with learning languages too - Indonesian and Spanish are beginner levels whilst I'm still learning Tagalog.
